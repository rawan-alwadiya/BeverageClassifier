## Project Overview

BeverageClassifier uses a robust ML pipeline to categorize wines into three classes based on 13 chemical features. The workflow includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Dimensionality Reduction using PCA
- Modeling with 7 classification algorithms
- Deployment through a Streamlit web app

All models exhibited similarly high performance on the test set. **Logistic Regression** was ultimately selected for deployment due to its interpretability, computational efficiency, and suitability for lightweight applications.

### Performance Metrics (Logistic Regression)
- **Accuracy**: 97.2%  
- **Precision**: 97.8%  
- **Recall**: 97.9%  
- **F1 Score**: 97.7%

## Project Workflow

- **Exploration & Visualization**: Histograms, pairplots, scatter plots, etc.  
- **Preprocessing**: Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`  
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA reduced 13 features to 2 principal components (56.2% variance retained)  
- **Modeling Algorithms**:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Support Vector Machine (RBF)  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosting  
  - HistGradientBoosting  
  - XGBoost  
  - CatBoost  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score  
- **Deployment**: Deployed using Streamlit for live predictions

## Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Wine Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine)  
- **Samples**: 178  
- **Features**: 13 chemical components  
- **Target Classes**: 3 wine cultivars

Each sample represents a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy.
